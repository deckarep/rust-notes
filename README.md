## [Intro to Rust - Alex Crichton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agzf6ftEsLU)

### Axioms of Rust

#### Ownership and Borrowing
- There is only ever **one owner of data**
- Ownership can be transferred to a new owner; this is known as a **move**.
- Ownership is a **deep property** of a type
- Owned values can be **borrowed temporarily**
- Borrowed values are only valid for a **particular lifetime**
- **Borrowing prevents moving** -- while there is an active borrow, the owner cannot be moved
- Borrows can be nested
- Borrowed values can become owned values through **cloning**

#### Memory Management
- Each variable has **a scope it is valid for**, and it is **automatically deallocated** when it goes out of scope
- Reference counting is another way of managing memory -- RC type
- Rust has shared memory but you must **explicitly opt into it**

#### Mutability
- Values are **immutable by default**
- Mutability is also part of the type of a borrowed pointer
- Borrowed pointers may coerce
- Values can be **frozen by borrowing**
- **Mutability propagates deeply** into owned types (just like ownership does)

#### Concurrency
- Parallelism is achieved at the granularity of an OS thread
- Safety is achieved by requiring that a `proc` owns captured variables  <== to to check this for newer Rust
- Threads can communicate with channels
- Tasks can also share memory -- Arc type <== check this for newer Rust

### Data Race
- 2 + threads accessing the same data
- at least 1 is unsynchronized
- at least 1 is writing

### Shared Nothing

```Rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel();

    for task_num in 0..8 {
        let tx = tx.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let msg = format!("Task {:?} done!", task_num);
            tx.send(msg).unwrap();
        });
    }

    drop(tx); // Effectively closes the channel

    for data in rx {
        println!("{:?}", data);
    }
}
```

### Shared Immutable Memory

```Rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use std::thread;
use std::sync::Arc;

struct HugeStruct{
   name: String
}

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel();
    let huge_struct = HugeStruct{name:"Ralph".into()};
    let arc = Arc::new(huge_struct);

    for task_num in 0..8 {
        let tx = tx.clone();
        let arc = arc.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let msg = format!("Task {:?} Accessed {:?}", task_num, arc.name);
            tx.send(msg).unwrap();
        });
    }

    drop(tx); // Effectively closes the channel

    for data in rx {
        println!("{:?}", data);
    }
}
```

### Mutation with Synchronization
```Rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use std::thread;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::sync::Mutex;

struct HugeStruct{
   name: String,
   access_count: i32
}

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel();
    let huge_struct = HugeStruct{name:"Ralph".into(), access_count:0};
    let arc = Arc::new(Mutex::new(huge_struct));

    for task_num in 0..8 {
        let tx = tx.clone();
        let arc = arc.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut guard = arc.lock().unwrap();
            guard.access_count +=1;
            let msg = format!("Task {:?} Accessed {:?} Name {:?}", task_num, guard.access_count, guard.name);
            tx.send(msg).unwrap();
        });
    }

    drop(tx); // Effectively closes the channel

    for data in rx {
        println!("{:?}", data);
    }
}
```

### [Fun Example: A generator function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/31392115/71079)
```Rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn gen_range(start: i32, end: i32) -> mpsc::Receiver<i32> {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel::<i32>();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in start..end {
            tx.send(i).unwrap();
        }
        drop(tx);
    });
    return rx;
}

fn main() {
    let range = gen_range(0, 50);
    
    for x in range {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
}
```

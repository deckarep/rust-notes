## [Intro to Rust - Alex Crichton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agzf6ftEsLU)

### Axioms of Rust

#### Ownership and Borrowing
- There is only ever **one owner of data**
- Ownership can be transferred to a new owner; this is known as a **move**.
- Ownership is a **deep property** of a type
- Owned values can be **borrowed temporarily**
- Borrowed values are only valid for a **particular lifetime**
- **Borrowing prevents moving** -- while there is an active borrow, the owner cannot be moved
- Borrows can be nested
- Borrowed values can become owned values through **cloning**

#### Memory Management
- Each variable has **a scope it is valid for**, and it is **automatically deallocated** when it goes out of scope
- Reference counting is another way of managing memory -- RC type
- Rust has shared memory but you must **explicitly opt into it**

#### Mutability
- Values are **immutable by default**
- Mutability is also part of the type of a borrowed pointer
- Borrowed pointers may coerce
- Values can be **frozen by borrowing**
- **Mutability propagates deeply** into owned types (just like ownership does)

#### Concurrency
- Rust's channels enforce thread isolation
- Thread safety isn't just documentation; it's the law
- Even the most daring forms of sharing are guaranteed safe in Rust
- Lock data; not code is enforced in Rust


## Iterators [Rust Camp 2015 - Who Owns this Stream of Data?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGW17shYtRM)
Why are there so many types of Iterators in Rust?  The answer lies in Ownership.

### IntoIter - Owned Values (T)
- Moves the data out of the collection
- You get total ownership
- Can do anything with the data, including destroy it

```Rust
fn process(data: Vec<String>){
	for s in data.into_iter() {
		println!("{}", s);
	}

    // Oh no! Iterating consumed it :(
	println!("{}", data.len()); //~ERROR
}
```

### Iter - Shared References (&T)
- Iter lets you look but not touch :)
- Shares the data in the collection
- Read-only access
- Can have many readers at once

```Rust
fn print(data: &Vec<String>){
	for s in data.iter(){
		//All I can do is read :/
		println!("{}", s);
	}
    // Yay it lives!
	println!("{}", data.len());
}
```

### IterMut - Mutable References (&mut T)
- Loans the data in the collection
- Read-Write access
- Only one loan at once
- IterMut gives you exclusive access

```Rust
fn make_better(data: &mut Vec<String>){
	for s in data.iter_mut(){
		//Ooh I can mutate you!
		s.push_str("!!!!");
		//But I can't share :(
	}
}
```

### Drain - I Drink Your Milkshake (Milkshake T) 
- Drain lets you partially move the data
- Full access to the elements
- Doesn't destroy the container

```Rust
let mut data = vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for x in data.drain(2..4){
	// got exclusive access so we can "drain"
	// the values out but leave the vec alive
	consume(x);
}

// data lives on! We can reuse the allocation!
// Bulk `remove`!
assert_eq!(&*data, &[0, 1, 4, 5]);
```

### Data Race
- 2 + threads accessing the same data
- at least 1 is unsynchronized
- at least 1 is writing

### Shared Nothing

```Rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel();

    for task_num in 0..8 {
        let tx = tx.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let msg = format!("Task {:?} done!", task_num);
            tx.send(msg).unwrap();
        });
    }

    drop(tx); // Effectively closes the channel

    for data in rx {
        println!("{:?}", data);
    }
}
```

### Shared Immutable Memory

```Rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use std::thread;
use std::sync::Arc;

struct HugeStruct{
   name: String
}

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel();
    let huge_struct = HugeStruct{name:"Ralph".into()};
    let arc = Arc::new(huge_struct);

    for task_num in 0..8 {
        let tx = tx.clone();
        let arc = arc.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let msg = format!("Task {:?} Accessed {:?}", task_num, arc.name);
            tx.send(msg).unwrap();
        });
    }

    drop(tx); // Effectively closes the channel

    for data in rx {
        println!("{:?}", data);
    }
}
```

### Mutation with Synchronization
```Rust
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
use std::thread;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::sync::Mutex;

struct HugeStruct{
   name: String,
   access_count: i32
}

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel();
    let huge_struct = HugeStruct{name:"Ralph".into(), access_count:0};
    let arc = Arc::new(Mutex::new(huge_struct));

    for task_num in 0..8 {
        let tx = tx.clone();
        let arc = arc.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut guard = arc.lock().unwrap();
            guard.access_count +=1;
            let msg = format!("Task {:?} Accessed {:?} Name {:?}", task_num, guard.access_count, guard.name);
            tx.send(msg).unwrap();
        });
    }

    drop(tx); // Effectively closes the channel

    for data in rx {
        println!("{:?}", data);
    }
}
```

### [Fun Example: A generator function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/31392115/71079)
```Rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn gen_range(start: i32, end: i32) -> mpsc::Receiver<i32> {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel::<i32>();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in start..end {
            tx.send(i).unwrap();
        }
        drop(tx);
    });
    return rx;
}

fn main() {
    let range = gen_range(0, 50);
    
    for x in range {
        println!("{}", x);
    }
}
```

### Ranges, Arrays, Slices, Vectors, Iterators oh my...

#### [Ranges](http://killercup.github.io/trpl-ebook/trpl-2015-09-26.a4.pdf)
```Rust
 	// Key take-aways: 
    // - Ranges start off as iterators (notice no need to convert)
    // - Ranges can represent infinite sequences
    // - Collecting must occur due to lazy evaluation
    
    // This does not actually generate anything
    let nums = 1..100;
    
    // It must be consumed
    let nums = (1..100).collect::<Vec<i32>>();

    // Collect a range into a vector
    let one_to_one_hundred = (1..101).collect::<Vec<_>>();
    print_type_of(&one_to_one_hundred); //std::vec::Vec<i32>

    // Find numbers in range returning an Option
    let greater_than_forty_two = (0..100).find(|x| *x > 42);
    print_type_of(&greater_than_forty_two); //std::option::Option<i32>

    match greater_than_forty_two {
        Some(_) => println!("We got some numbers!"),
        None => println!("No numbers found :("),
    }
    
    // Filter numbers in range returning a vector
    let greater_than_forty_two = (0..100)
        .filter(|x| *x > 42)
        .collect::<Vec<_>>();

    print_type_of(&greater_than_forty_two); //std::vec::Vec<i32>
    println!("greater_than_forty_two: {:?}", greater_than_forty_two);
```


### [Let's get functional](https://mmstick.gitbooks.io/rust-programming-phoronix-reader-how-to/content/chapter02.html)

#### With numbers again
```Rust
let numbers_iterator = [0,2,3,4,5].iter();

let sum = numbers_iterator
 	.fold(0, |total, next| total + next)
	.collect();

let squared = (1..10).iter()
	.map(|&x| x * x).collect();
```

#### With numbers again
```Rust
fn main() {
    let inf_range = (1..)         // Infinite range of integers
        .filter(|x| x % 2 != 0)   // Collect odd numbers
        .take(5)                  // Only take five numbers
        .map(|x| x * x)           // Square each number
        .collect::<Vec<usize>>(); // Return as a new Vec<usize>

    println!("{:?}", inf_range);  // Print result
}
```

#### With Strings
```Rust
fn main() {
    let sentence = "This is a sentence in Rust.";
    let words: Vec<&str> = sentence
  		.split_whitespace()
        .collect();

    let words_containing_i: Vec<&str> = words.into_iter()
        .filter(|word| word.contains("i"))
        .collect();

    println!("{:?}", words_containing_i);
}
```

### What type am I?
This feature requires Rust Nightly, this helper method allows for figuring out what type you are working with
Just pass a reference to it of whatever type you are holding

```Rust
#![feature(core_intrinsics)]

fn print_type_of<T>(_: &T) -> () {
    let type_name = unsafe { std::intrinsics::type_name::<T>() };
    println!("{}", type_name);
}
```
